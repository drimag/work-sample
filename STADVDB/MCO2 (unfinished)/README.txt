Project Description:

The course project on Transactions Management is a venue for students to practice building a distributed database system that supports concurrent multi-user access. Students will once again use the SeriousMD Appointments dataset to design a three-node distributed database system where they perform concurrent transactions and simulate crash and recovery techniques. The final output includes: (1) a web-based software that will be demonstrated during the indicated schedule to the respective STADVDB teachers and fully tested using a test script with the different test cases described below, and (2) a technical report documenting the whole project.

as of apr 6, the distributed database system has already been built, some relevant screenshots included
